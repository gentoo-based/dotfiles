<h1 align="center">My Dotfiles for SwayFX or Niri</h1>

This is where I keep all of my dotfiles and scripts for my rice.

Feel free to copy any of the dotfiles or scripts you find here, as much of it is just copied from others' dotfiles. I wouldn't recommend cloning my entire setup, but instead to try copying bits and pieces as you put together your own dotfiles unique to you. As what I did to my own dotfiles. I started to learn how to do stuff in ricing!

I used to host a DNS server for unbound here so yeah.

For other projects made by me, go to my [Page](https://codeberg.org/based-kiryu). There, you'll see my projects that I am working on, such as my dotfiles, and different types of reimplementation of fetcher, a reimagined neofetch that suddenly discontinued.

### Utilities that I use:
1. **[dinit](https://github.com/davmac314/dinit)**
- An initializer for any Linux systems that support it made by [Davmac](https://github.com/davmac314/). Here is the portage overlay that I use: https://github.com/WavyEBuilder/dinit-overlay.

2. **[ungoogled-chromium](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium)**
- An ungoogled version of chromium as a replacement for Brave that I use.

3. **[Niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri)**
- A scrollable-tiling window manager made by YaLTeR (His made some good stuff!)

4. **[Gentoo Linux](https://gentoo.org)**
- Gentoo is a free operating system based on Linux that can be automatically optimized and customized for just about any application or need.

5. **[Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar)**
- Highly customizable Wayland bar for Sway and Wlroots based compositors.

6. **[Pipewire](https://pipewire.org)**
- PipeWire is a project that aims to greatly improve handling of audio and video under Linux. It provides a low-latency, graph-based processing engine on top of audio and video devices that can be used to support the use cases currently handled by both PulseAudio and JACK. PipeWire was designed with a powerful security model that makes interacting with audio and video devices from containerized applications easy, with support for Flatpak applications being the primary goal. Alongside Wayland and Flatpak, we expect PipeWire to provide a core building block for the future of Linux application development.

7. **[Z Shell](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/)**
- Zsh is a shell designed for interactive use, although it is also a powerful scripting language. Many of the useful features of bash, ksh, and tcsh were incorporated into zsh; many original features were added.
